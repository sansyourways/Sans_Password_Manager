"""SPM trusted core: vault format, key handling and vault mutation.

Everything that decides how a vault is protected lives here and nowhere else.
The CLI reaches it through the command interface at the bottom of this file;
the SPM Dashboard imports it directly. Before this module both surfaces
carried their own copy of the container format, the key wrapping, the version
stamping and the history archiving, and a regression test existed purely to
prove the two copies still agreed -- which is a test that a shared
implementation does not need.

Secrets never appear in argv. The command interface reads them from stdin,
and gpg receives them on a dedicated file descriptor, because argv is
world-readable through `ps` and /proc/<pid>/cmdline.
