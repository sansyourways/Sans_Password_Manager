# GDPR Privacy Notice  
For Sans Password Manager (SPM)  
Effective Date: January 2025  
© 2025 Sansyourways. All Rights Reserved.

Sans Password Manager (“SPM”, “the Software”) is designed from the ground up to protect user privacy.  
SPM operates **fully offline**, performs **all encryption locally**, and does **not collect or process any personal data** under the meaning of the GDPR.

This GDPR Notice explains how SPM aligns with GDPR’s principles of privacy, data minimization, and user control.

---

## 1. Data Controller
For the purposes of GDPR, **no external Data Controller or Processor exists**, because:

- SPM does not send data to the developer.  
- SPM does not transmit any information over the internet.  
- All data stays exclusively on the user’s device.

**You, the user, are the sole Data Controller** of all data stored inside SPM.

The developer (Sansyourways) does not access, receive, process, or store user data.

---

## 2. Personal Data Processing
SPM **does not process any personal data** within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of GDPR.

SPM does not:

- Collect personal information  
- Store personal information  
- Upload or transmit data  
- Process data on remote servers  
- Track usage or analytics  
- Use cookies or similar technologies  
- Log IP addresses or identifiers  
- Use third-party SDKs or trackers  

All information remains strictly **offline and local**.

---

## 3. Data Stored Locally by the User
Users may voluntarily save data inside SPM, such as:

- Password entries  
- Secure notes  
- Vault files  
- Backup files (portable bundles / ZIPs)  

This data is:

- Created by the user  
- Encrypted locally using GnuPG or AES  
- Stored only on the user’s device  
- Never transmitted or shared with the developer  

Because no data is collected or processed by Sansyourways, GDPR obligations of data storage, retention, or deletion do not apply to the developer.

---

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing
SPM performs **no processing of personal data**, therefore:

- Article 6 legal bases do not apply  
- No consent is required  
- No legitimate interest, contract, or compliance basis is used  

All functionality is executed locally without external involvement.

---

## 5. Data Transfers
SPM performs **zero data transfers** to:

- EU  
- EEA  
- Third countries  
- Cloud services  
- Developers  
- External servers  

Because SPM does not transmit data at all, Articles 44–50 regarding international data transfers do not apply.

---

## 6. Third-Party Access
SPM has **no third-party integration**.  
No data is shared with:

- Advertisers  
- Analytics services  
- Cloud providers  
- SDKs  
- API endpoints  
- External data processors  

There are no accessible backdoors, telemetry endpoints, or cloud sync features.

---

## 7. User Rights Under GDPR
Since the developer does not collect any personal data, the following rights:

- Right of access  
- Right to rectification  
- Right to erasure  
- Right to data portability  
- Right to restrict processing  
- Right to object  
- Right not to be subject to automated decision-making  

**do not apply to the developer**, because no data exists on our side.

All rights remain under the user's own control through their device and self-managed data.

---

## 8. Security
SPM uses local encryption including:

- GnuPG (OpenPGP)  
- AES variants  
- Key derivation (PBKDF2)  

However, the **user is fully responsible** for:

- Master password  
- Recovery key  
- Vault backups  
- Storage location  
- Device security  

The developer cannot recover lost passwords or vaults.

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy
SPM does not collect data from any user, including children.  
The application contains no online features.

---

## 10. Contact Information

**Security:** security@sansyourways.com

## 11. Updates to This Notice
We may update this GDPR Notice if required by law or if functionality changes.  
SPM will remain offline and privacy-focused.

Continued use of SPM signifies acceptance of the updated Notice.
